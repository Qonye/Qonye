- 👋 Hi, I’m @Qonye
- 👀 I want to conquer the world through vibecoding. I believe agentic AI has broken the barrier to entry in software and web development, your creativity is your limitation, and I believe learning by doing is easier with these tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in general 
- 💞️ I’m full of commercially viable ideas but lack the technical know-how on execution. Minor update: I am learning the process through vibecoding.
- 📫 You can reach me at Konyemartin@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a genius level of idea creation and explaining it, but zero knowledge and motivation on execution. I can be your genie who keeps spilling ideas
